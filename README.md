# SCYTHE <img width="24" height="24" alt="icon" src="https://fkerimk.com/scythe/icon.png" />

A personal game development framework or anything like that, idk.

## What is this?

A simple, mod based game development framework I made for my own games; containing basic tools and features.

Nothing fancy. Itâ€™s not designed to take you to space. You can take a look if you want, but itâ€™s probably not a project youâ€™ll need.

> [!NOTE]  
> Scythe is not a game engine. Itâ€™s developed with Unity. Itâ€™s simply a Unity-based toolkit/framework.

## Building

> [!CAUTION] 
> Scythe hasnâ€™t even learned to crawl yet. Itâ€™s not mature enough to be of any real use to you.

Make sure you have the .NET 10 SDK packages installed.

Builder is only available for the fish shell.

> [!NOTE] 
> Make sure youâ€™ve entered the correct Unity path in `build/config.ini`. You can configure the build using `build/config.ini`.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fkerimk/scythe.git
cd scythe
build/build.fish
```

It automatically builds lib, util, core, run and the mod.

> [!CAUTION]  
> Support for the Windows is no longer available.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can take a Windows build directly from Linux, you just canâ€™t build from Windows.
